The sources can be disjoint (mutually exclusive), such that only one source emits at a given instant, or superposed, such that the electric fields are summed.  It is also possible to simulate integration over a composite sample of unresolved disjoint modes.\r\n\r\n### Amplitude modulation\r\nBy default, the components of the electric field vector will be normally distributed; optionally, the amplitude of the vector can be modulated with an independent random variable drawn from a lognormal distribution. This amplitude modulating function can be boxcar smoothed or it can be set to a contiguous sequence of rectangular pulses.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nepsic was written by Willem van Straten (@straten) in consultation with Caterina Tiburzi in support of our paper that will soon be published in The Astrophysical Journal.\r\n",
